# generator-composer
This is a Yeoman module for a set of Yeoman generators. These are used to create pro-forma templates for using with the Hyperledger Composer.
There are two current generators that can be used from the point of creating a model through to creating command line applications

The naming of this repository is following the Yeoman naming conventions.

# What are the generators I can use?

##> yo composer:app

### Description
This command generates a basic command line application which can deploy a business network and list all the asset registries.

### Limitations
- None

### Supported Examples
- DigitalProperty-Network


##> yo composer:angular

### Description
This command generates an Angular2 application which can connect to a business network and perform create, read, update and delete operations on assets.

### Limitations
- The generated application currently does not handle operations regarding participants and transactions
- The generator currently lacks certain customization and options
