    Background:
        Given I have deployed the business network definition basic-sample-network
        And I have added the following participant of type org.acme.sample.SampleParticipant

            | asset  | newValue |
            | 1      | 100      |
        Then I should have received the following event of type org.acme.sample.SampleEvent

    Scenario: I should get an error when I do not receive an event of type (1)
        Then I should have received the following event of type org.acme.sample.SampleEvent
