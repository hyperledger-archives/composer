# Tutorials

---

We have two basic tutorial options. For developers, we recommend reading the [**developer guide**](../tutorials/developer-guide.html). This guide presumes you have a development environment setup including the [**installation of the development tools**](../installing/development-tools.html). For other users, we recommend the [**playground guide**](../tutorials/playground-guide.html).

### Developer Guide

The developer guide will walk you through the steps required to build a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} blockchain solution from scratch. In the space of a day or so you should be able to go from an idea for a disruptive blockchain innovation to a complete business network, running on {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

### Playground Guide

The Playground guide runs through importing the car auction sample business network. In this guide, you'll create participants, assets, and transactions; set up and run the auction, and verify that the transactions worked correctly.

If you want to run the playground guide locally [install the Playground locally](../installing/using-playground-locally.html) first, then use the playground guide.
