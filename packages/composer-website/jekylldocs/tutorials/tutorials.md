# Tutorials

We have two basic tutorial options, and one more advanced tutorial:

## Playground Tutorial

The Playground tutorial runs through using the Playground to track the ownership of commodities in a business network.

If you want to run the playground tutorial locally [install the Playground locally](../installing/using-playground-locally.html) first, then use the playground tutorial.

## Developer Tutorial

This tutorial presumes you have a development environment setup including the [**installation of the development tools**](../installing/development-tools.html).

The developer tutorial will walk you through the steps required to build a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} blockchain solution from scratch. In the space of a day or so you should be able to go from an idea for a disruptive blockchain innovation to a complete business network, running on {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

## Query Tutorial

This tutorial presumes that you have some experience using {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}.

In this tutorial, we will build on the 'Commodity Trading' developer tutorial, extending it to show the use of queries in {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}. This tutorial demonstrates the power of the native {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} query language to filter results returned using criteria and to perform operations on result sets, such as updating or removing assets using a transaction function that uses queries.

## Deploying to a single organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}

This tutorial presumes that you have experience setting up an instance of {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

In this tutorial, {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} is configured for a running instance of {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} and a business network is deployed using that configuration.

[**Start the single organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} deployment tutorial**](../tutorials/deploy-to-fabric-single-org.html)

## Deploying to a multi-organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}

This tutorial presumes that you have experience using {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

In this tutorial, two organization administrators configure their instances of {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} to interact with the same channel in {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.
