# Tutorials

We have two basic tutorial options:

## Playground Guide

The Playground guide runs through using the Playground to track the ownership of commodities in a business network.

If you want to run the playground guide locally [install the Playground locally](../installing/using-playground-locally.html) first, then use the playground guide.

[**Start Playground Guide**](../tutorials/playground-guide.html)

## Developer Guide

This guide presumes you have a development environment setup including the [**installation of the development tools**](../installing/development-tools.html).

The developer guide will walk you through the steps required to build a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} blockchain solution from scratch. In the space of a day or so you should be able to go from an idea for a disruptive blockchain innovation to a complete business network, running on {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.
