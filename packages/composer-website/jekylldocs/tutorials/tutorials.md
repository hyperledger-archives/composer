# Tutorials

---

We have four basic tutorial options, and two more advanced tutorials:

## Playground Tutorial

The Playground tutorial runs through using the Playground to track the ownership of commodities in a business network.

This tutorial can be followed using the web Playground (no install necessary) or with your own Playground (acquired as part of the install instructions).

[**Start Playground Tutorial**](../tutorials/playground-tutorial.html)

## Developer Tutorial

This tutorial presumes you have a development environment setup including the [**installation of the development tools**](../installing/development-tools.html).

The developer tutorial will walk you through the steps required to build a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} blockchain solution from scratch. In the space of a day or so you should be able to go from an idea for a disruptive blockchain innovation to a complete business network, running on {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

[**Start Developer Tutorial**](../tutorials/developer-tutorial.html).

## Access Control Language (ACL) Tutorial
This tutorial presumes that you have some experience using {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}.
In this tutorial, you will incrementally build ACL rules for a sample Commodity Trading business network, and test the ACLs as an integral step during the rules build. You can complete the tutorial in the online Playground (and you deploy the Trade sample network there) ; but you can equally complete the tutorial if you deploy that sample network to your {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} runtime.

[**Start the ACL tutorial**](../tutorials/acl-trading.html).

## Query Tutorial

This tutorial presumes that you have some experience using {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}.

In this tutorial, we will build on the 'Commodity Trading' developer tutorial, extending it to show the use of queries in {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}. This tutorial demonstrates the power of the native {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} query language to filter results returned using criteria and to perform operations on result sets, such as updating or removing assets using a transaction function that uses queries.

[**Start the queries tutorial**](../tutorials/queries.html).

## Deploying to a single organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}

This tutorial presumes that you have experience setting up an instance of {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

In this tutorial, {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} is configured for a running instance of {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} and a business network is deployed using that configuration.

[**Start the single organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} deployment tutorial**](../tutorials/deploy-to-fabric-single-org.html).

## Deploying to a multi-organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}

This tutorial presumes that you have experience using {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

In this tutorial, two organization administrators configure their instances of {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} to interact with the same channel in {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}.

[**Start the multi-organization {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} deployment tutorial**](../tutorials/deploy-to-fabric-multi-org.html).

## Invoking a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} business network from another business network

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the steps that a business network developer needs to take in order to invoke a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} business network from a different business network

[**Start the invoking a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} business network from another business network tutorial**](../tutorials/invoke-composer-network.html).
