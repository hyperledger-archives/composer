# Using the Playground to run a Car Auction

---

## Before you begin

Before beginning, you will need:

* A GitHub account (if you want to import sample business network from GitHub)
* A supported browser i.e. any modern version of Chrome, Firefox or Safari

**OPTIONAL** You can follow this tutorial using a local install of Playground: [Install Local Playground](../getting-started/using-playground-locally.html)

---
## Let's get started - Importing the Car Auction sample

1. Open the [{{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} Playground](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net). On the left are three file types: a script file, `lib/logic.js` which represents transaction logic, a model file, `lib/org.acme.biznet.cto` which defines the participants assets and transactions of the business network, and an access control file, `permissions.acl` which defines the access different participants have.

2. To get switch out the sample business network click **Import/Replace**. This dialog allows you to import your own business network archive `.bna` files, or to import our premade business network samples. For now we'll use a pre-built sample from the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} GitHub repository. Click **Authenticate with GitHub** then log into your GitHub account and click **Authorize application**.

3. From the menu, select **carauction-network** and click **Deploy**. This imports the car auction sample business network into your Playground instance. In the model file `lib/org.acme.vehicle.auction.cto` there are the definitions of asset types, participant types, and transactions. The entries in the `.cto` file define the expected format of each asset, participant, and transaction. The script file `lib/logic.js` contains JavaScript
which controls the transactions, in this script file, there is JavaScript logic controlling the `Close Bidding` and `Make Offer` transactions.

### Setting up the auction

1. To get a better understanding of how business network definitions work in practise, click the **Test** tab at the top. From this screen, we can create assets and participants, and submit transactions.

2. To start with, add a *Member* participant by clicking **Member** then clicking **Create New Participant**. Enter the balance, email, and name credentials for the new participant in the following format, then click **Create New**. The credentials which are required for each participant are defined in the `.cto` file viewable in the **Define** tab.

        {
          "$class": "org.acme.vehicle.auction.Member",
          "balance": "100",
          "email": "alice@biznet.org",
          "firstName": "Alice",
          "lastName": "Smith"
        }

3. Create two more *Members* in the same way as the previous step, with different balance, email, and name credentials. Then, click the **Auctioneer** participant type on the left, and then create an Auctioneer participant by click **Create New Participant**.

4. Now that there are three *Members*; two to bid against each other and another to be the initial owner of the *Vehicle* asset. We also have an *Auctioneer* to close the bidding. Next we need an assets, in this case a *Vehicle* asset, for them to bid over, and a *Vehicle Listing* asset to control the reserve price and record the current highest offer.

5. To create a *Vehicle* asset, click **Vehicle**, then **Create New Asset**. Enter the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and the email address of the owner. In this case, enter the email address of one of the *Members* created in step 5 or 6, then click **Create New** to finish creating the asset. Now, the asset exists and has a set owner. The *Vehicle* asset credentials must be in the following format, as defined in the `.cto` file.

        {
          "$class": "org.acme.vehicle.auction.Vehicle",
          "vin": "1234",
          "owner": "dave@biznet.org"
        }

6. Next, to sell the car at auction, an auction listing asset must be created. Assets can be any tangible or intangible goods or services, in this case, the auction listing itself. To create the auction listing, click **VehicleListing** then click **Create New Asset**. The *VehicleListing* requires several properties, and should have the following format:

        {
          "$class": "org.acme.vehicle.auction.VehicleListing",
          "listingId": "listing_1",
          "reservePrice": 2000,
          "description": "dave's car",
          "state": "FOR_SALE",
          "offers": [],
          "vehicle": "1234"
        }

### Running the auction

1. Now that you have *Members* to own and bid on an asset, an *Auctioneer*, a *Vehicle* asset with registered ownership, and a *VehicleListing* asset to track the bids, reserve price, and state of the auction. The next step is to begin using transactions to interact with assets. This sample includes the *Offer* and *CloseBidding* transactions. Transactions, combined with assets and participants, make up the economic model of a business network. Transactions can modify, transfer, or otherwise alter assets, as in this sample, where transactions allow participants to place bids or allow the auctioneer to close the auction. Placing a bid uses the *Offer* transaction. To submit a transaction, click the **Submit Transaction** button. In the dialog box, use the dropdown to select the *Offer* transaction type. The *Offer* transaction requires a number of properties and should have the following format:

        {
          "$class": "org.acme.vehicle.auction.Offer",
          "bidPrice": "1000",
          "listing": "listing_1",
          "member": "alice@biznet.org"
        }

2. Now that you've submitted an *Offer* transaction, we can check that it has been successfully applied to the *VehicleListing* asset. Click **VehicleListing** and then click **Show All** in your listing entry. You should see that there is now an entry for the *Offer* transaction in the `offers` property of the listing asset. Congratulations, you've just made your first bid!

3. To represent a counter-offer or raise from another member, repeat step 10, increasing the `bidPrice` property and changing the `member` who is placing the bid. After you have submitted a second *Offer* transaction, the *VehicleListing* asset should update to show that both bids have been placed.

4. When you've placed as many bids as you like, the next step is to submit the *CloseBidding* transaction to close the auction. The *CloseBidding* transaction pays the previous owner of the *Vehicle* asset listed in the *VehicleListing* the current highest offer, changes the `state` of the listing to `SOLD`, and transfers ownership of the *Vehicle* asset, as listed in the `owner` property, to the highest bidder. To submit the *CloseBidding* transaction, click **Submit Transaction** and enter the `listingId` which corresponds to the *VehicleListing*. Click **Submit** to submit the transaction. Once the transaction has been submitted, you can check the *Vehicle* asset's `owner` property to ensure that it has changed, as well as checking the `balance` of the previous and new owner of the car, and the *VehicleListing* `state`.

5. You've successfully run the `carauction-network` {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} sample! If you want to continue to use this business network in future tutorials or for testing, click **Export** in the **Define** tab to download a Business Network Archive `.bna` file. A `.bna` file contains all files listed in the business network, in this example, `README.md`, `lib/logic.js`, `lib/org.acme.vehicle.auction.cto`, and `permissions.acl`.

If you want to continue to modify your business network, you could add some new fields to asset types in the business network definition, for example, make or model for *Vehicle* assets.
