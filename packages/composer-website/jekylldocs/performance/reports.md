# {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Performance Reports

---

This section contains links to the performance reports for different versions of {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}}. Within the reports we provide information on achievable transactions per second (TPS) for business network transaction scenarios and micro tests.

Transaction scenarios involve multiple interactions with the underlying blockchain platform, and represent the execution of a Transaction Processor Function within a deployed business network. The transaction scenarios use the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} sample networks hosted on npm. 

Micro tests investigate the performance of the Composer API to perform a single action, such as issuance of a query. They differ from transaction scenarios in that the execution of a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} transaction processor function encapsulates a unit of business logic; a micro test investigates the individual elements of the business logic.
