# Fabric Composer Generator

---

The `composer generator` utility is used to automatically generate parts of your project from your business network archive.

## Tests
`composer generator tests` generates a framework for testing the transactions in the business network archive. The test file uses `mocha` and `chai` and will be saved

```
composer generator tests -d <project-directory> -a <business-network-archive> -i <enrollment-id> -s <enrollment-secret>
```
