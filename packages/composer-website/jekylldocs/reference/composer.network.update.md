# {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Network Update

---

The `composer network update` utility is used to update a deployed business network archive from local disk to a Hyperledger Fabric runtime.

```
composer network update -a <business-network-archive> -i <enrollment-id> -s <enrollment-secret>
```

The business network definition must have been previously deployed to the Fabric. The business network definition
is replaced within the same chaincode container.

### Options
```
  --help                       Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version                Show version number  [boolean]
  --archiveFile, -a            The business network archive file name  [string] [required]
  --connectionProfileName, -p  The connection profile name  [string]
  --enrollId, -i               The enrollment ID of the user  [string] [required]
  --enrollSecret, -s           The enrollment secret of the user  [string]
  ```
