# {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Archive Create

---

The `composer archive create` utility is used to create a business network archive from the contents of a directory.

To create an archive from source flles (ie business network definition project files) present in the current 'working' directory:

```bash
composer archive create -a <business-network-archive>
```

or

to specify paths (to a source business network definition,  and a destination directory for the archive file (.bna file)):

```bash
composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName <dirpath> -a digitalproperty-network.bna
```

### Options

```
--help             Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version      Show version number  [boolean]
  --archiveFile, -a  Business network archive file name. Default is based on the Identifier of the BusinessNetwork  [string]
  --inputDir, -d     Location to create the archive from e.g. NPM module directory
  --moduleName, -m   Name of the npm module to use

Only one of either inputDir or moduleName must be specified.
```
