# {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} Runtime Install

---

The `composer runtime install` command is used to install the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} runtime on the {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} endorsing peers of the blockchain network you are connecting to. This command must be run before the `composer network start` command.

_Please Note_: The `--businessNetworkName, -n` option **must** contain the same name as the business network name you intend to run on the {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} endorsing peers. Only business networks with names matching the `--businessNetworkName, -n` option given in this command will successfully run.
