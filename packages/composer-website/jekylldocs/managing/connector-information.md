# Connector Specific Information

{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} is designed to be platform-agnostic


## {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}

There are several cases where information specific to {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} must be included in {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} commands, including `composer network deploy`, and `composer identity issue`.
