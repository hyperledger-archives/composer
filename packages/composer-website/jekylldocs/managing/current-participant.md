# Implementing participant-based access control

The current participant can be used to implement access control in a transaction processor function. You can use the type and the identifier of the current participant to permit or reject the execution of a transaction processor function.

## Before you start

Before you follow these steps, you must have modeled a participant in a Business
Network Definition and deployed it as a Business Network. You must have created
some instances of those participants, and issued those participants with identities.

The procedure below shows an example using the following participant models:

```
namespace net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork

participant Person identified by personId {
  o String personId
  o String firstName
  o String lastName
}

participant PrivilegedPerson extends Person {

}
```

## Procedure

1. In your transaction processor function, verify the type of the current participant
   meets the requirements by using the `getCurrentParticipant` function:

   ```javascript
   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {
       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();
       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedType() !== 'net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.PrivilegedPerson') {
           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by a privileged person');
       }
       // Current participant must be a privileged person to get here.
   }
   ```

2. In your transaction processor function, verify the participant ID of the current
   participant by using the `getCurrentParticipant` function:

   ```javascript
   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {
       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();
       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier() !== 'net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.Person#PERSON_1') {
           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by person 1');
       }
       // Current participant must be person 1 to get here.
   }
   ```

   The participant ID of the current participant can be compared to a participant
   that is linked to an asset (by a relationship) to verify that the current
   participant has the authority to access or modify an asset:

   ```javascript
   function onPrivilegedTransaction(privilegedTransaction) {
       // Get the owner of the asset in the transaction.
       var assetOwner = privilegedTransaction.asset.owner;
       var currentParticipant = getCurrentParticipant();
       if (currentParticipant.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier() !== asset.owner.getFullyQualifiedIdentifier()) {
           throw new Error('Transaction can only be submitted by the owner of the asset');
       }
       // Current participant must be the owner of the asset to get here.
   }
   ```
