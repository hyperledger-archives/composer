# Binding an existing identity to a participant

An existing identity can be issued to a participant using either the API or the command line.
Once the existing identity has been bound, the identity can then be used by the participant
to interact with the business network in the context of that participant.

When using {[site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}, you can bind existing certificates that have been created
by using the {[site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} certificate authority (CA) or by using other tooling such
as `cryptogen`. The existing certificates must be valid for use for submitting transactions
on the {[site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} network.

## Before you start

Before you follow these steps, you must have added a participant to a participant
registry. You must have an existing certificate in the PEM format to bind to the
participant. The **binder** of the existing identity (whether using command line or
using the Javascript APIs below) must have ACLs that permit them to bind the identity
(to be associated with the participant) in {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}}.

The procedure below shows an example using the following model of a participant
from the Digital Property sample Business Network Definition: [digitalproperty-network](https://www.npmjs.com/package/digitalproperty-network)

```
namespace net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork

participant Person identified by personId {
  o String personId
  o String firstName
  o String lastName
}
```

The example assumes that an instance, `net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork#mae@biznet.org`,
of that participant has been created and placed into a participant registry.

## Procedure

1. Connect to the business network and bind an existing identity to a participant
  * JavaScript API

  ```javascript
  const BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;
  let businessNetworkConnection = new BusinessNetworkConnection();
  let certificate = `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIB8DCCAZegAwIBAgIURanHh55fqrUecvHNHtcMKiHJRkwwCgYIKoZIzj0EAwIw

    rkM5DH3e5ECM7T+T1Ovr+1AK6bs=
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----`
  return businessNetworkConnection.connect('admin@digitalPropertyNetwork')
      .then(() => {
          return businessNetworkConnection.bindIdentity('net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.Person#mae@biznet.org', certificate)
      })
      .then(() => {
          return businessNetworkConnection.disconnect();
      })
      .catch((error) => {
          console.error(error);
          process.exit(1);
      });
  ```
  * Command line


        composer identity bind -c admin@digitalPropertyNetwork -a "resource:net.biz.digitalPropertyNetwork.Person#mae@biznet.org"


2. As the participant, test the connection to the business network
  * JavaScript API

  ```javascript
  const BusinessNetworkConnection = require('composer-client').BusinessNetworkConnection;
  let businessNetworkConnection = new BusinessNetworkConnection();
  return businessNetworkConnection.connect('admin@digitalPropertyNetwork')
      .then(() => {
          return businessNetworkConnection.ping();
      })
      .then((result) => {
          console.log(`participant = ${result.participant ? result.participant : '<no participant found>'}`);
          return businessNetworkConnection.disconnect();
      })
      .catch((error) => {
          console.error(error);
          process.exit(1);
      });
  ```

  * Command line


        composer network ping -c admin@digitalPropertyNetwork

  The participant ID will be printed to the console, and should match the participant
  ID that was specified in the `composer identity bind` command.
