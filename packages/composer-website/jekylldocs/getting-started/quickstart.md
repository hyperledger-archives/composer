The steps below enable you to get started with the Composer sample application.

<!-- These steps will install the Composer sample application running against Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. To use Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 run the optional command in step 2. -->
You can choose to install the latest **v0.6** Composer sample application (uses a Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 environment) or the **v1.0** sample application (uses a Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 environment) and give us feedback.

## Before you begin

Check that your system has the required software (at the required versions) installed:

```
Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
Docker Engine: Version 1.12.x
Docker-Compose: Version 1.8.x
Node: 6.x (note version 7 is not supported)
npm: 3.10.x
git: 2.9.x
```

If you need to update or install any of the prerequisites, please refer to [installing prerequisites](../installing/prerequisites.md)

## Procedure
# Hyperledger Composer Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started by standing up a Hyperledger Fabric, and then getting a simple Hyperledger Composer Business Network deployed and an application running against it.

There are two version of Hyperledger Fabric : v0.6 and v1.0-alpha.  The default is for v1.0-alpha and we suggest this is the one you use.

## Step 1: Getting Hyperledger Fabric running

These scripts use Node v6, and bash, which are Hyperledger Composer depencies. Choose a directory that you wish to have the setup scripts within.

1. In a directory of your choice (will assume `~/fabric-tools`) get the zip file that contains the tools
```
$ mkdir ~/fabric-tools && cd ~/fabric-tools
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.zip
$ unzip fabric-dev-servers.zip
```


2. Choose which version of Fabric to use. For v0.6 this needs to be set explicitly as follows.

```
$ export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv0.6
```

For v1.0-alpha, there is *nothing to as this the default*. But to 'unset' the v0.6, or to be explicit in using v1 use this command

```
$ export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv1
```

3. If this is the first time, you'll need to download the fabric first. If you have already downloaded then first start the fabric, and create a Composer profile.  After that you can then choose to stop the fabric, and start it again later. Alternatively to completely clean up you can teardown the Fabric and the Composer profile.

All the scripts will be in the directory `~/fabric-tools`  A typical sequence  for Hyperledger Composer use would be

```
$ cd ~/fabric-tools
$ ./downloadFabric.sh
$ ./startFabric.sh
$ ./createComposerProfile.sh
```

Then at the end of your development session

```
$ cd ~/fabric-tools
$ ./stopFabric.sh
$ ./teardownFabric.sh
```

*If you want to swap between v0.6 and v1.0, ensure you have issued a `stopFabric.sh` and a `teardownFabric.sh` command first be START on the other version*

## Script details

### Downloading Fabric

Issue from the `fabric-tools` directory
```
$ ./downloadFabric.sh
```

### Starting Fabric

Issue  from the `fabric-tools` directory
```
$ ./startFabric.sh
```

### Stop Fabric

Issue from the `fabric-tools` directory
```
$ ./stop.sh
```

### Create Composer Profile

Issue from the `fabric-tools` directory
```
$ ./createComposerProfile.sh
```

Note: this create a Hyperledger Composer profile specifically to connect to the development fabric you've already started.

### Teardown Fabric

Issue from the `fabric-tools` directory
```
$ ./teardownFabric.sh
```


### Command Ordering

This diagram should to clarify the order in which the scripts can be run.  Remember the version will default to hlfv1 if the version command is not run.

# Step 2: Getting the Hyperledger Composer sample application

0. Make sure you've started Fabric as in Step 1 above. For example, If this is your first time for exaple

```
$ cd ~/fabric-tools
$ ./downloadFabric.sh
$ ./startFabric.sh
$ ./createComposerProfile.sh
```

1. Clone the sample application into a directory of your choice - BUT not the same directory as in Step 1. (Assume `~/github')
```
$ mkdir ~/github && cd ~/github
$ git clone https://github.com/mbwhite/composer-sample-applications
$ cd composer-sample-applications
$ npm install
```

2. When you started fabric you will have chosen which version to use.  If you have chosen Fabirc v0.6 you will need to suffix the targets in the npm commands below with `:hlfv06`. Both examples are given below - do not issue both commands!

*Note: this does not change the application source code or the model, purely the name of the Composer profile to use, and the Fabric's admin indentity*

3. Deploy the business network

```
$ cd getting-started
$ npm run deployNetwork
$ npm run deployNetwork:hlfv0.6     # if you want to use v0.6
```

5. Run the sample application
```
$ npm test
$ npm test:hlfv0.6     # if you want to use v0.6
```

# Step 3: And next
To recap, a fabric has been started, and the Composer framework has been deployed to the Fabric, along with a sample business network.
An application that uses this network has been run.

## Troubleshooting
A useful information node.js script has been created to show the available sample applications
```
$ node ~/github/composer-sample-applications/info.js
```
