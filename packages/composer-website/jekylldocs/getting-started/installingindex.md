There are two ways to install {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}}. To model, develop, or test business networks, [install the {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} Playground locally](../tutorials/getting-started-playground.html) or [use the playground online](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net).

If you want to develop and test applications, connect to a running {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} instance, or run {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} and {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} locally, see [installing {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}}](../installing/quickstart.html).
