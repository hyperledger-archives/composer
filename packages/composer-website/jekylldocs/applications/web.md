# Writing Web or mobile Applications

Web or mobile applications that need to interact with deployed business networks should make calls to a REST API. The easiest way to create the REST API is to use the `composer-rest-server` to dynamically generate a REST API from the deployed business network.

In addition the `yo hyperledger-composer` command can be used to generate a skeleton Angular project that calls the `composer-rest-server` to interact with a business network.

Please follow the Developer Guide for an example of how to use the `composer-rest-server` and the Angular generator.
