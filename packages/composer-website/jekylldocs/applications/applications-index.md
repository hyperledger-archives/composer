# Developing Applications


{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} supports creating web, mobile or native Node.js applications. It includes the `composer-rest-server` (itself based on LoopBack technology) to automatically generate a REST API for a business network, and the `hyperledger-composer` code generation plugin for the Yeoman framework to generate a skeleton Angular application.

In addition it includes a rich set of JavaScript APIs to build native Node.js applications.
