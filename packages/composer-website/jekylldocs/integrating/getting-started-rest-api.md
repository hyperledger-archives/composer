# Generating a REST API

## Running the REST server
{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} includes a standalone Node.js process that exposes a business network as a REST API. The LoopBack framework is used to generate an Open API, described by a Swagger document.

To launch the REST Server simply type:

```bash
composer-rest-server
```

You will then be asked to enter a few simple details about your business network.

```bash
