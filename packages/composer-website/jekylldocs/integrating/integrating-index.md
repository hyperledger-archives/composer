# Integrating existing systems

---

{{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} can be integrated with existing systems by using a Loopback API. Integrating existing systems allows you to pull data from existing business systems and convert it to assets or participants in a {{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} business network.

For instructions on setting up a Loopback API, see [Generating a REST API](../integrating/getting-started-rest-api.html).
