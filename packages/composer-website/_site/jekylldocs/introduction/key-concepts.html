<h2 id="key-concepts-in">Key Concepts in</h2>

<h3 id="blockchain-state-storage">Blockchain State Storage</h3>

<p>The current state of assets and participants are stored on the blockchain, administered by .  runs consensus checks to ensure the validity of all blocks in the blockchain. For more information on  consensus, see the <a href="https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_model.html#consensus"> documentation</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>

<p>Assets are tangible or intangible goods, services, or property, and are stored in registries. Assets can represent almost anything in a business network, for example, a house for sale, the sale listing, the land registry certificate for that house, and the insurance documents for that house may all be assets in one or more business networks.</p>

<p>Assets must have a unique identifier, but other than that, they can contain whatever properties you define.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>

<p>Participants are members of a business network. Participant types can be defined and limited by an access control document which makes up part of the business network definition.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="transactions">Transactions</h3>

<p>Transactions are the mechanism by which participants interact with assets. This could be as simple as a participant placing a bid on a asset in an auction, or an auctioneer marking an auction closed, automatically transferring ownership of the asset to the highest bidder.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="events">Events</h3>

<p>Events are defined in the business network definition in the same way as assets or participants. Once events have been defined, they can be included in the transaction processor functions to be emitted as part of a transaction. Applications can subscribe to emitted events through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-client</code> API.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="apis">APIs</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-admin</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-client</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-common</code> components contain the APIs to interact with a  runtime. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-rest-server</code> component generates a unique RESTful API for interacting with your deployed business network.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="hyperledger-fabric-10-support">Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 Support</h3>

<p>supports the existing <a href="https://hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Fabric blockchain</a> infrastructure and runtime, and supports pluggable blockchain consensus protocols to ensure that transactions are validated according to policy by the designated business network participants.</p>

<p>Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 adds support for channels, orderers, and certificate authorities. For more information on Hyperledger Fabric v1.0, see the <a href="https://hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Fabric documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Hyperledger Fabric versions 0.6 and 1.0 are supported.</p>
