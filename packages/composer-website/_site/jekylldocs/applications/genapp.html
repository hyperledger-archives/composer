<hr />

<p>We’re going to assume that you’ve been through the Getting Started section and would like to now start to look at writing your own application to use .</p>

<p>To help getting started with this, there’s a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator that creates a suitable directory structure and helps bring in the required model and network modules.</p>

<h2 id="yeoman">Yeoman</h2>

<p>If you don’t already have it, install Yeoman</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g yo
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you wish to use the Angular 2 Application Generator, then you will need a few other globally installed packages</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g typings

npm install -g bower

npm install -g @angular/cli
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then install the generator for it</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer

<p>Firstly it creates a standard npm module with the usual attributes of name, author, description.
Secondly it asks a set of  questions to help create the sample structure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NPM Module name:  What is the name of the business network you want to connect to - and is this the same as the modules NPM registry name</li>
  <li>Connection Profile:  This is the connection profile used to locate ip/ports etc of the running fabric</li>
  <li>The EnrollmentId/Secret: Are needed to create a connection to the fabric</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testing-this-has-worked">Testing this has worked</h3>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file is a very simple application that lists the asset registries that have been defined.</p>

<p>This generator can be ran using <code class="highlighter-rouge">yo hyperledger-composer:angular</code>.</p>

<p>The user has the ability to generate an application in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Generating the application by connecting to a running business network</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generating the application with a business network archive file</p>

<p>Firstly the generator will also a series of basic regarding the application name, author, description, etc.
Then it will ask the user to enter the details required to connect a running business network.
After the generator has stopped prompting the user to answer questions, it will then attempt to connect to the business network using the details provided.
If it successfully connects to the business network, the generator will then examine the assets, transactions and participants.
The generator will then create Angular components based upon the different modelled types.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business Network Identifier:  This is the name of the business network you want to connect to - and is this the same as the modules NPM registry name</li>
  <li>Business Network Archive File: This is a business network definition archived using the Composer-CLI</li>
  <li>Connection Profile:  This is the connection profile used to locate IP/ports etc of the running fabric</li>
  <li>The EnrollmentId/Secret: Are needed to create a connection to the fabric</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rest-api-options">REST API Options</h3>

<p>If generating an application with a business network archive file, it is only possible to connect to an existing REST API server which is running.</p>

<p>When generating an application it is possible to either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate and bundle the application with a REST API server</li>
  <li>Connect to an existing REST API server</li>
</ol>

<p>This REST API server configuration can be edited in <code class="highlighter-rouge">APP_DIR/src/app/configuration.ts</code>.</p>
