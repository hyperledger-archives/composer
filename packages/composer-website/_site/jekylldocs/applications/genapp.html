<hr />

<p>We’re going to assume that you’ve been through the Getting Started section and would like to now start to look at writing your own application to use .</p>

<p>To help getting started with this, there’s a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator that creates a suitable directory structure and helps bring in the required model and network modules.</p>

<h2 id="yeoman">Yeoman</h2>

<p>If you don’t already have it, install Yeoman</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g yo
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you wish to use the Angular2 Application Generator, then you will need a few other globally installed</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g typings

npm install -g bower

npm install -g @angular/cli
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then install the generator for it</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install -g generator-fabric-composer
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="running-the-generator">Running the generator</h2>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>yo fabric-composer

<p>This generator can be ran using <code class="highlighter-rouge">yo fabric-composer:cli</code></p>

<h4 id="what-does-this-do">What does this do?</h4>
<p>Firstly it creates a standard npm module with the usual attributes of name, author, description.
Secondly it asks a set of  questions to help create the sample structure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NPM Module name:  What is the name of the business network you want to connect to - and is this the same as the modules NPM registry name</li>
  <li>Connection Profile:  This is the connection profile used to locate ip/ports etc of the running fabric</li>
  <li>The EnrollmentId/Secret: Are needed to create a connection to the fabric</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="testing-this-has-worked">Testing this has worked</h4>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file is a very simple application that lists the asset registries that have been defined.</p>

<h3 id="angular2-application">Angular2 Application</h3>

<p>The user has the ability to generate an application in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Generating the application by connecting to a running business network</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generating the application with a business network archive file</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This generator can also be ran using <code class="highlighter-rouge">yo fabric-composer:angular</code></p>

<p><strong>1. Generating the application by connecting to a running business network</strong></p>

<p>Firstly the generator will also a series of basic regarding the application name, author, description, etc.
Then it will ask the user to enter the details required to connect a running business network.
After the generator has stopped prompting the user to answer questions, it will then attempt to connect to the business network using the details provided.
If it successfully connects to the business network, the generator will then examine the assets, transactions and participants.
The generator will then create Angular components based upon the different modelled types.</p>

<p><strong>2. Generating the application with a business network archive file</strong></p>

<p>Firstly the generator will also a series of basic regarding the application name, author, description, etc.
Then it will ask the user to enter the relative path to a business network archive file.
After the generator has stopped prompting the user to answer questions, it will then attempt to read the business network archive file provided.
If it successfully reads the file, the generator will then examine the assets, transactions and participants.
The generator will then create Angular components based upon the different modelled types.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business Network Identifier:  This is the name of the business network you want to connect to - and is this the same as the modules NPM registry name</li>
  <li>Business Network Archive File: This is a business network definition archived using the Composer-CLI</li>
  <li>Connection Profile:  This is the connection profile used to locate ip/ports etc of the running fabric</li>
  <li>The EnrollmentId/Secret: Are needed to create a connection to the fabric</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="testing-this-has-worked-1">Testing this has worked</h4>

<p><strong>1. Generating the application by connecting to a running business network</strong></p>

<p>After the application has been generated, the application can be started using <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm start</code> inside of the application directory.</p>

<p><strong>2. Generating the applicaiton with a business network archive file</strong></p>

<p>After the application has been generated, a business network needs to be deployed to a live fabric.
Once this has been done, you will then need to change into applications <code class="highlighter-rouge">config</code> directory.
Inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.json</code>, the connection profile, business network identifier, enrollment id and secret to connect to the business network need to be set.
The application can be then be started using <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm start</code>.</p>

<p>The generated application can then be tested using <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm test</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run e2e</code>.</p>

<h1 id="generating-tests">Generating Tests</h1>

<p>Note that after the application is generated you may choose to add skeletal tests to your application using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer generator tests</code> command.</p>
