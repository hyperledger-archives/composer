<h1 id="installing-and-running-the--playground">Installing and running the  Playground</h1>

<p>This tutorial will take you through how to install and run the  Playground.</p>

<p>The  Playground is a web development experience that allows you to develop a business network definition, deploy that business network definition to a running instance of Hyperledger Fabric, and test the deployed business network by working with assets, participants, and transactions.</p>

<p>Playground can also be used in a “browser only” mode, without a running instance of Hyperledger Fabric. When used in this mode, all the functionality of  Playground is available, but all of the data (business networks, assets, participants, and transactions) is persisted into browser local storage.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to start a Hyperledger Fabric instance for use with  Playground by using Docker Compose. If you already have a running instance of Hyperledger Fabric, or you only want to work in “browser only” mode, then skip to <a href="#installationoptions">alternative installation options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you’ve previously used  Playground or Hyperledger Fabric, but wish to clear everything out and start again, the following commands will delete any running containers and delete all downloaded images (be careful if you’re using other Docker images on your machine):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm -f
docker images -aq | xargs docker rmi -f
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>In order to install  Playground, you need the following software installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker Engine 1.12.3 or greater</li>
  <li>Docker Compose 1.8 or greater</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>Download the example Docker Compose file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/tutorials/docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(Alternatively, you can do this by right clicking this link and clicking on “Save Link As”: <a href="./docker-compose.yml" download="">docker-compose.yml</a>)</p>

<p>The Docker Compose file describes a multi-container application that is made up of three Docker containers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hyperledger Fabric peer, v0.6.1</p>

    <p>This container will use ports 7050 (HTTP), 7051 (gRPC), 7052 (gRPC), 7053 (gRPC, events)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hyperledger Fabric membership services, v0.6.1</p>

    <p>This container will use ports 7054 (gRPC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Composer Playground</p>

    <p>This container will use ports 8080</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory that you downloaded the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> file into, and run the following commands to start a Hyperledger Fabric instance and  Playground:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  docker pull hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:x86_64-0.1.0
  docker tag hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:x86_64-0.1.0 hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:latest
  docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should see the following output in your terminal or command prompt:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  $ docker pull hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:x86_64-0.1.0
  x86_64-0.1.0: Pulling from hyperledger/fabric-baseimage

  $ docker-compose up -d
  Creating start_membersrvc_1
  Creating start_vp0_1
  Creating start_composer_1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Verify that no errors occurred. If you see an error similar to the following error, then you may have an existing Hyperledger Fabric instance or other service running on any of the ports used by the Docker Compose file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  ERROR: for membersrvc  Cannot start service membersrvc: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint start_membersrvc_1 (c99c05cca95c9bbcd75c0520bb2166cbf67fc660cd58924f095cdbecf4ad86da): Bind for 0.0.0.0:7054 failed: port is already allocated
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you see this error, ensure that all of these ports are free before you run any commands.</p>

<p>If everything started OK, you should be able to access  Playground by clicking on this link: <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="blank">http://<span></span>localhost:8080</a></p>

<h1 id="connecting-to-hyperledger-fabric">Connecting to Hyperledger Fabric</h1>

<p>The Basic Sample Network is loaded into the UI by default - it’s the “Hello World” of  samples.  The Web Browser Connection Profile is in use to start with, so any data you create by testing your model will be stored in browser memory.</p>

<p>The docker-compose command you ran also started a Hyperledger Fabric instance that you can activate to have  Playground connected to a blockchain instance.  To do so, head to the Connection Profiles panel of the UI (click the globe icon in the top-right) and activate the “hlfabric” Connection Profile.</p>

<h1 id="alternative-installation-options"><a name="installationoptions"></a>Alternative installation options</h1>

<p>If you have an existing Hyperledger Fabric instance you want to use with  Playground, then you can install the playground without installing another Hyperledger Fabric instance. The playground can then be configured to connect to your existing Hyperledger Fabric instance by creating a connection profile with the required connection settings.</p>

<p>There are two options for installing the  Playground.
You can choose to install using npm (the Node.js package manager), or you can choose to install with Docker. We recommend that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#installnpm">Install using npm</a> if you wish to run to  Playground on your local workstation.</li>
  <li><a href="#installdocker">Install using Docker</a> if you wish to run  Playground on a server or cloud platform.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>Note that the same set of features is available regardless of the installation method that you choose.</p>

<h2 id="installing-with-npm"><a name="installnpm"></a>Installing with npm</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>In order to install  Playground with npm, you need the following software installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Node.js v6.x (note that Node.js v7.x is unsupported)</li>
  <li>npm v3.x or greater</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation-1">Installation</h3>

<p>You can install  Playground by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  npm install -g composer-playground
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should see the following output in your terminal or command prompt:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  npm install -g composer-playground
  ...
  /usr/local/bin/composer-playground -&gt; /usr/local/lib/node_modules/composer-playground/cli.js
  /usr/local/lib/node_modules
  └─┬ composer-playground@0.4.3
  ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Verify that no errors occurred. If any part of this process fails, then  Playground will fail to work correctly. You may see errors from a program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-gyp</code>. These errors indicate that your system is not set up correctly to build Node.js C/C++ native modules. You may need to install additional software to correct this error.</p>

<p>You can then start  Playground by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  composer-playground
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A web browser will be automatically opened once the playground has started, but should that not happen you should be able to access  Playground by clicking on this link: <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://<span></span>localhost:8080</a></p>
