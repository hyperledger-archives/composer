<hr />

<p>A business network definition is composed of three major items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic metadata for the business network definition (name, version and description)</li>
  <li>a set of domain models that define the structure of the participants, assets and transactions within the network</li>
  <li>a set of scripts that define business logic</li>
</ul>

<p>This generates a skeleton business network with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">asset</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">participant</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">transaction</code> defined, as well as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">mocha</code> unit test.</p>

<p>Also included, is a ‘best practices’ eslint config file</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

<p>A Business Network Definition has a name (limited to basic ASCII alphanumeric characters and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>), a human-readable description and a version number. The version number for the network should take the form Major.Minor.Micro and
<a href="semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a> principles should be used when incrementing the version number.</p>

<p>The identifier of the network is formed from its name, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code> character and its version number. A valid identifier is therefore <code class="highlighter-rouge">mybusinessnetwork-0.6.3</code>.</p>

<p>The metadata for a business network definition is read from <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code>, meaning that business network definitions may also be valid <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> packages.</p>

<h2 id="domain-models">Domain Models</h2>

<p>The set of domain models for a business network definition define the types that are valid within the network and outside the network when it is integrated with external systems (for example systems that submit transactions to the network).</p>

<p>A domain model may either be packaged within the business network definition (typically stored under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">models</code> directory), or may be declared in <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> as an external dependency. You would refer to models via a dependency if you wanted to share them across business network definitions, for example.</p>

<h2 id="scripts">Scripts</h2>

<p>The scripts for a business network definition are typically stored under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib</code> directory and are packaged within the business network definition. The scripts are written in ES 5 JavaScript and refer to the types that are defined in the domain models for the business network.</p>

<h1 id="business-network-archive">Business Network Archive</h1>

<p>Prior to deploying or updating a business network definition it must be archived using the ZIP standard. A typical ZIP will contain a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> a <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib</code> folder containing one or more <code class="highlighter-rouge">.js</code> files and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">models</code> folder containing one or more <code class="highlighter-rouge">.cto</code> files.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer</code> CLI contains commands for creating an archive, deploying business network archives and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BusinessNetworkDefinition.fromArchive, toArchive and fromDirectory</code> APIs can be used to programmatically create business network definitions.</p>
