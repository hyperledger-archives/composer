<hr />

<p>You can update a business network definition to a running Fabric using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer network update</code> CLI command.</p>

<p>Prior to updating an existing business network definition you should ensure that you have a Connection Profile for the Fabric you want to deploy to on your local machine (or create one).</p>
