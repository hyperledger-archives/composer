<h1 id="business-network-definition">Business Network Definition</h1>

<hr />

<p>Business Network Definitions are a key concept of the  programming model. They are represented by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BusinessNetworkDefinition</code> class, defined in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-common</code> module and exported by both <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-admin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-client</code>.</p>

<p>Business Network Definitions are composed of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a set of model files</li>
  <li>a set of JavaScript files</li>
</ul>

<p>The model files defined the business domain for a business network, while the JavaScript files contain transaction processor functions. The transaction processor functions run on a Hyperledger Fabric and have access to the asset registries that are stored in the world state of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.</p>

<p>The model files are typically created by business analysts, as they define the structure and relationships between model elements: assets, participants and transactions.</p>

<p>The JavaScript files are typically created by developers who are implementing business requirements provided by business analysts.</p>

<p>Once defined, a Business Network Definition can be packaged into an archive using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer</code> command line interface. These archives can then be deployed, undeployed or updated on a Fabric, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdminConnection</code> class from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-admin</code> module.</p>
