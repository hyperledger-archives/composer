<hr />

<p>After you have deployed a business network definition it is often useful to run a “smoke test” to ensure that the deployment was successful. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer</code> CLI exposes several commands for running such smoke tests.</p>

<p>In addition you can write full-blown system tests using Docker Compose and Chai, that start a Fabric, deploy your business network definition and then programmatically create assets, submit transactions and inspect the state of asset registries.</p>

<h2 id="creating-assets">Creating Assets</h2>

<p>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer-client</code> module and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BusinessNetworkConnection</code> API to add assets to an asset registry.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-registries">Viewing Registries</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">composer network list</code></p>

<h2 id="submitting-transactions">Submitting Transactions</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">composer transaction submit</code></p>

<h2 id="writing-assertions">Writing Assertions</h2>

<p>Use popular JavaScript assertion libraries such as Sinon and Chai.</p>

<h1 id="generating-tests">Generating Tests</h1>

<p>You may choose to add skeletal tests to your application using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer generator tests</code> command.</p>
