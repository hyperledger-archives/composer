<hr />

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer network undeploy</code> command <strong>permanently disables a business network</strong>. Once a business network has been undeployed, it cannot be redeployed.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: When using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">undeploy</code> command with a business network running on  v1.0, the business network remains running, but will become unresponsive. The business network <strong>cannot be redeployed or updated once the <code class="highlighter-rouge">undeploy</code> command has been issued.</strong> This is because the business network is already deployed, but has been set to be unresponsive.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>composer network undeploy -a &lt;business-network-archive&gt; -i &lt;enrollment-id&gt; -s &lt;enrollment-secret&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that <strong>after undeploy the business network definition can no longer be used</strong>, however the docker container
associated with the business network definition is still running. The docker container for the business network
definition must be explicitly stopped and removed if no longer needed.</p>
