<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer network ping</code> utility is used to verify the connection to a business network deployed to a Hyperledger Fabric.
Note that ping also returns the participant information for the identity that was used to connect to the network, if
an identity has been issued for the participant.</p>
