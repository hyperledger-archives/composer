Feature: Cli network steps

    Background:
        Given I have admin business cards available
        And I have deployed the business network marbles-network

    Scenario: Using the CLI, I can ping the network that I just started
        When I run the following expected pass CLI command
            """
            composer network ping --card admin@marbles-network
            """
        Then The stdout information should include text matching /The connection to the network was successfully tested: marbles-network/
        And The stdout information should include text matching /participant: org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin#admin/
        And The stdout information should include text matching /identity: org.hyperledger.composer.system.Identity#.+?/
        And The stdout information should include text matching /Command succeeded/

    Scenario: Using the CLI, I can verify that there no assets have been created yet
        When I run the following expected pass CLI command
            """
            composer network list --card admin@marbles-network -r org.hyperledger_composer.marbles.Marble

        And The stdout information should include text matching /registryType: Asset/
        And The stdout information should include text matching /Command succeeded/

    Scenario: Using the CLI, I can update the network to a newer version
        Given I have the following folders
            | ../resources/sample-networks/marbles-network-update |
        And I run the following expected pass CLI command

    Scenario: Using the CLI, I can validate my network update
        When I run the following expected pass CLI command
