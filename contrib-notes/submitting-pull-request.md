# Submitting a Pull Request

*Before* submitting a pull request, please search carefully for any open or closed pull requests that relate to the issue you are targetting.

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
- Follow our [coding guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md) when making your coding changes.
- Ensure that all test suites pass locally (`npm test`).
- Commit any changes using a descriptive commit message.
- Pull requests that have associated builds that are not 100% clean will be closed.
