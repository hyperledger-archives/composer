# Submitting a Pull Request

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Pull requests that have associated builds that are not 100% clean will be closed.
