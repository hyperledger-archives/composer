# Getting Started Developing Hyperledger Composer

This guide will help you start to contribute to the Hyperledger Composer project. It will show you how to set up your local environment and walk through the development, code, test and deploy process. You will do this by creating a small change of your own.

Please note that this is the **Getting Started** for developing Hyperledger Composer itself, and not a guide to developing applications **using** Hyperledger Composer.  (Though a lot of the tool chain will be useful for that purpose as well).

## Setup Scripts

The requirements for developing Hyperledger Composer are the same as developing an application using Hyperledger Composer. Follow these [instructions](./prerequisites.md)  

If you wish to install manually or review the individual tool's own documentation the details are below.

## Tool Chain Reference Details
This is a summary of the tools that will be required to work on Hyperledger Composer. Other tools are required but these will be installed automatically.  

- **Git** This is probably already installed on most Linux machines. Setup is well documented on the [ibm.git website](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.7/user/articles/set-up-git/) . Pay particular attention to[ setting up the SSL keys](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.7/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux) that are required.

- **Docker** Essential for the running of the tests and for running the HyperLedger Fabric.
    - Ubuntu: Firstly the Docker Engine needs to be [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/), then the [docker-compose tool](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is required with these instructions. Some initial notes on administering docker are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/)

- **Node.js  v6** The main runtime of Hyperledger Composer and also has the NPM tool that is used for a lot of the package management.
    - Ubuntu: Simply installed [follow these notes](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).

- **Chrome** Web test suites use **karma** to launch a browser, and consequently **Chrome** must be installed to prevent test failures without editing the karma configuration to use a supported browser that you already have installed.

## Forking and Cloning the Hyperledger Composer Repository

Once those tools are installed you are ready to get going with the Hyperledger Composer repository. Let's show you how to create your own version of the Hyperledger Composer repository on GitHub, and clone it to your local machine to allow you to make your own changes, which you can subsequently contribute to the Hyperledger Composer project.

- Navigate to the [Hyperledger Project](https://github.com/hyperledger) on GitHub to see the
different Hyperledger Composer repositories.
- Select the [Hyperledger Composer repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer)
- Click on the `Fork` button to fork this repository to your user space.
- Navigate to your home page on GitHub, you'll be able to see your fork of the repository.

## Choosing a Location For Your Clone

If this is your first Git project then you might like to spend a few moments creating a specific directory for all your local git repositories, e.g. ``~/github/`` on unix file systems, which will put the project under your home directory, which is good default location. Windows note: this will all be done in the git bash shell that was installed for you.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/github
cd ~/github
```

_IMPORTANT_ Do NOT have any directory in the path to the git repository directory you just created, start with a _  (underscore). This is due to the way that the JavaScript documentation tool handles filtering path names. If you do this, then the tool reports there are no source files to produce documentation for.

The final step is to issue the clone command. This format is assuming that you have setup the ssh keys for GitHub.

```bash
git clone git@github.ibm.com:<your-username>/hyperledger/composer.git
cd composer
```

### Hyperledger Code Dependencies

There is a temporary requirement for Hyperledger Composer to include the Hyperledger source code in its project directory. The following commands will pull the code from the Hyperledger code repository, as defined in the `.gitmodules` file in the Hyperledger Composer project directory.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You can see where the Hyperledger source code is pulled from; it is saved in the `.git` directory of the Hyperledger Composer project.

## Installing Hyperledger Composer Prerequisites

Hyperledger Composer has a number of prerequisites - for its runtime, code hygiene, tests, API documentation, and more.  Before you can develop locally, you need to install these using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). These prerequisites are installed as development dependencies. The packages are installed locally rather than globally so that their versions do not interfere with other projects you may be developing or global installations of these packages on your local machine.  You can also install these prerequisites globally, though it is required to have some packages locally, e.g. the test framework.

### Installing the npm Dependencies

You must install [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) to build this multi-package repository:

    $ npm install -g lerna@2.0.0-rc.4

You must bootstrap the repository so that all of the dependencies are installed and all of the packages are linked together:

    $ lerna bootstrap

You can then work with the packages under [packages/](packages/) on a per-package
basis as any normal node.js package.

Alternatively, you can execute npm commands across all of the packages at once using
Lerna:

    $ lerna run test

To clean the updates

    $ lerna clean


### Your development environment is ready!

You are now ready to try out your local clone of the Hyperledger Composer project.

## Testing your local environment

To verify that your local environment is ready for development and to confirm later that the updates are good, run the built-in unit tests provided with the Hyperledger Composer project.  

    $ lerna run test

This will run the unit tests that are associated with all the modules.
