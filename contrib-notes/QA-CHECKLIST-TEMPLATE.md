### Pre-requisties

  - [ ] Current state of the build is green with all test passing, and all aspects green:  This is for a merge build, not a pull request.
     - This ensures that the code is clean, unit and systests are passing, documentation is being generated, npm and docker images pushed to the repositories, and the Bluemix images have been pushed
  - [ ] Ensure that any CRON jobs that are run are also passing


## Standard Verification

- [ ] Running the pre-req scripts on clean platform images (within a virtualized environment, install from ISO image of Ubuntu. Follow the preqrequistie tool chain as documented on the website.)
- [ ] Run the QuickStart and follow on tutorials to ensure they are correct [_note currently this means following the instructions on the website, however there is a plan to automate this_]
- [ ] Yo Generator (Angular + CLI) - generates and the code runs succesfully
- [ ] Expose as REST API tutorial

*Documentation*

- [ ] Are the JSDocs being produced and linked correctly
- [ ] Look over the support pages, and the getting started tutorials; are their omissions broken links etc.  


## UI

### Stable UI

 - [ ] Review model, and submit transaction

<!-- The Engagement teams lab @ https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/141636016965 is a good source of the process and information for the Composuer-UI -->
