### Documentation

Following through the documentation tutorials should have been a smooth process, with NO road blockers or work arounds - which includes the need to know any specialist (in depth) knowledge, knowing that a password has changed, knowing that a small edit to a script file is required etc.

Have their been any RocketChat or stack overflow questions realting to the documentation this week, and have we been through the documentation for that particular issue without any blockers?
