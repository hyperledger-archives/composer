[Atom](https://atom.io/) is the preferred code editor for contributors the fabric composer project.  Many developers find Atom especially productive due to the wide range of plugins availability to assist with code development activities. These include syntax highlighting for node.js code, JavaScript and the Composer modelling language, or *linting* to help eliminate potential bugs and ensure a consistent coding style. Developers can also develop their own plugins. Here's a list of Atom plugins  for you consider as you develop within the fabric composer project.
