# Deploying a Business Network

---

A business network is deployed using the `composer network deploy` command.

## Procedure
1. Before deploying a business network, a [Business Network Definition]() is needed as a `zip` file with the following structure:

    ```
    BusinessNetworkArchive.zip
    ├── lib
    │   └── mozart.cto.js
    ├── models
    │   └── mozart.cto
    └── package.json
    ```

    -	**lib** contains all of the transactions processor functions
    -	**models** contains all of the model files written in the [CTO Language](../reference/cto_language.md).
    -	**package.json** is required, and is used to create the [Business Network Definition](../reference/businessnetworkdefinition.md)'s identifier

    You can use the `composer archive` command to create an archive with the correct format.

    **NOTE**: *Do not zip a a folder containing **lib**, **models**, and **package.json** to create an Business Network Archive, zip the contents themselves*

2. Start [Hyperledger Fabric Peer and Membership Service]()

3. [Create a Connection Profile](createconnectionprofile.md) or do *not* use `-p` and allow Fabric Composer to create a `Default Connection Profile` for you.

4. Enter the command on a single line. For example:

    `composer network deploy -a <BusinessNetworkDefinition>.zip -i <Your EnrollmentID>`

5. Enter your Enrollment Secret when prompted.

    `prompt: What is the enrollment secret of the user?:`

6. When you see

    ```
    Deploying business network definition. This may take a little time.
    Command completed successfully.
    ```
    you have successfully deployed a business network!
