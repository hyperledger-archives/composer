<p>The major components of Fabric Composer are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Fabric Composer language for describing the structure of resources (assets, participants and transactions) that participate in a blockchain-mediated business network.</li>
  <li>Javascript APIs to query, create, update and delete resources and submit transactions from client applications. Fabric Composer resources are stored on the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Javascript transaction processor functions that runs on Hyperledger when transactions are submitted for processing. These functions may update the state of resources stored on the blockchain via server-side Concerto APIs.</li>
  <li>A web network builder and tools to interactively test Fabric Composer-based solutions.</li>
</ul>
