<h1 id="fabric-composer-network-undeploy">Fabric Composer Network Undeploy</h1>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer network undeploy</code> utility is used to undeploy a business network from a Hyperledger Fabric runtime.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>composer network undeploy -a &lt;business-network-archive&gt; -i &lt;enrollment-id&gt; -s &lt;enrollment-secret&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that after undeploy the business network definition can no longer be used, however the docker container
associated with the business network definition is still running. The docker container for the business network
definition must be explicitly stopped and removed if no longer needed.</p>
