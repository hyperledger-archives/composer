<h1 id="connection-profile">Connection Profile</h1>

<p>The AdminConnection and BusinessNetworkConnection classes use references to named Connection Profiles to connect to a running Fabric. A Connection Profile captures the URLs and configuration options required to connect to a physical instance of the Hyperledger Fabric.</p>

<p>Connection Profiles are stored under sub-directories of the ‘concerto-connection-profiles’ directory in the user’s home directory.</p>

<p>For example, if connecting using the ‘testprofile’ Connection Profile, the ‘<homedir>/.composer-connection-profiles/testprofile' directory must exist, and must contain a file named 'connection.json'.</homedir></p>

<p>The contents of the file will depend on the location of the Fabric, but will be similar to the example below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  ``{
      "type": "hlf",
      "keyValStore": "/home/&lt;your-username&gt;/.concerto-credentials",
      "membershipServicesURL": "grpc://localhost:7054",
      "peerURL": "grpc://localhost:7051",
      "eventHubURL": "grpc://localhost:7053"
  }``
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This connection profile connects to a Fabric instance running on localhost and places the HFC keyValStore under the ‘/tmp/keyValStore’ directory.</p>

<p>Connection Profiles may be shared across a development team to ensure that everyone on the team is using consistent connection information. The use of Connection Profiles ensures that physical connection details are not stored in application code.</p>
