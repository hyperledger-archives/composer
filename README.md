# Fabric Composer

Fabric Composer is an application development framework which simplifies and expedites the creation of [Hyperledger fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) blockchain applications. If you're new to Blockchain, Hyperledger fabric or Fabric Composer, we recommend that  you start at the [Fabric composer website](https://fabric-composer.github.io). This site will help you get up and running by developing a sample blockchain application to buy and sell houses and apartments in a digital property business network.
